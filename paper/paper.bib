@article{VANDYKE1951,
  abstract = {Methods are studied for imporving the existing perturbation theories of axial and inclined supersonic flow past bodies of revolution. For axial flow, a second-order solution is developed using an interation procedure based upon the linearized solution. The resulting second-order problem is reduced to an equivalent first-order problem by discovery of a particular solution. The second-order supersonic flow can then be computed with slight modification of the Karman-Moore procedure. For inclined flow, no particular solution of the second-order equation has been discovered. The second-order solution is derived for a cone, and agrees well with the exact solution. The slender-body series expansion of the second-order solution is found to cause large inaccuracies in both the axial and inclined flows. The conclusion that first-order theory predicts the inclined flow no better than slender-body theory is shown to be erroneous. Non-linearity in lift is shown to result primarily from viscous separation of the crossflow along the after portions of the body. (Author)},
